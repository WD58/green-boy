### **Description:**

This is my custom aseprite theme. It's been in development for over 3 years now, being slowly updated for each aseprite release, and being tweaked to give its  own spin on aseprite's UI elements (mostly making some cursors more cartoony, like the hands and pipette).

There are 2 variants included in the .zip file, a light and dark theme (the dark theme being easier on the eyes), but both use the same [palette](https://lospec.com/palette-list/sweet-guarana).

_the icon is from a slightly older version (so the version you download will be slightly different than depicted)._


Expect this theme to be updated in the future, and please let me know if anything looks wrong/off/needs to be updated ASAP.


### **Install instructions:**
In Aseprite, install the .zip file through **Preferences _(Ctrl+K)_ > Extensions** in the **Add Extension** menu, then enable it through **Preferences > Themes**.

You can change between light and dark mode through **Preferences > Themes**, or (if you are currently using the theme, through **Preferences > General**.

If these instructions aren't clear enough for you (which is fair), please refer to [this video guide from MortMort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKlLqL9eLY)


### **v1.1 Changelog:**
- Minor fixes (such as the "close tab" icon not displaying correctly in some cases)
- Various slight modifications (like the shadow on the icon, dotted separators, new radio button and check mark icons and backgrounds, etc)
- Inactive tabs now react to being hovered over
