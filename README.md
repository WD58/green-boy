### **Description:**

This is my custom aseprite theme. It's been in development for over 3 years now, being slowly updated for each aseprite release, and being tweaked to give its  own spin on aseprite's UI elements (mostly making some cursors more cartoony, like the hands and pipette).

There are 2 variants included in the .zip file, a light and dark theme (the dark theme being easier on the eyes), but both use the same [palette](https://lospec.com/palette-list/sweet-guarana).
Expect this theme to be updated in the future, and please let me know if anything looks wrong/off/needs to be updated ASAP.

### **Install instructions:**
In Aseprite, install the **.zip** or **.aseprite-extension** file through **Preferences _(Ctrl+K)_ > Extensions** in the **Add Extension** menu, then enable it through **Preferences > Themes**.
You can change between light and dark mode through **Preferences > Themes**, or (if you are currently using the theme, through **Preferences > General**.
If these instructions aren't clear enough for you (which is fair), please refer to [this video guide from MortMort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soKlLqL9eLY)
### **Enabling Custom fonts (v1.2+):**
Unfortunately, Aseprite doesn't automatically install the fonts packaged with the theme, so to use them, you have to install them manually. Please follow these steps:
After installing the theme, in **Preferences > Themes**, click on Greenboy then **Open Folder**.

On the file explorer, click the provided **.ttf** files and install them.

The fonts should be enabled after you re-open Aseprite.


### **v1.1 Changelog:**
- Minor fixes (such as the "close tab" icon not displaying correctly in some cases)
- Various slight modifications (like the shadow on the icon, dotted separators, new radio button and check mark icons and backgrounds, etc)
- Inactive tabs now react to being hovered over

### **v1.2 Changelog**
- Updated to the latest version of aseprite (should still work on previous versions)
- New custom fonts! (still works without them)
- Improved timeline buttons for consistency and readability
- Refined tool icons
- Inverted some timeline buttons states so it's more consistent with itself
- Overhauled buttons' visuals and centered most icons that were previously off-center
- Introduced a bunch of hover-reactive elements (i.e. tabs and layers popping up when the cursor hovers over)

Known Issues:
- Some text elements may appear glitched when switching themes (this only happens initially, and reopening the window fixes this in most cases)
- Suffixes are displayed too close to text (fixed in aseprite v1.3.14)
- Some ext fields have their top pixel cutoff
- Can't see the selected palette's info and pin buttons until hovered (will be fixed someday)
